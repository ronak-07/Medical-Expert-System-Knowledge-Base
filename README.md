Medical-Expert-System-Knowledge-Base
====================================================
Using expert system shells for the development of Expert systems. These shells are empty Expert System knowledge bases, which have the structure and interface already written for us; all we need to do is to add the knowledge into the KB. Instead of writing an Expert System from scratch, for this problem we will be using a small Expert System shell to design and implement an expert system. We used PyKnow Framework for building the concerned expert system.

Idea
------------------
Many rural areas in India have extremely limited access to medical advice. People travel long distances to clinics, or medical facilities and there is a shortage of medical experts in most of these facilities. This results in slow service, and patients end up waiting long hours without receiving any attention. Hence, medical expert systems can play a significant role in such cases where medical experts are not readily available. A Diagnosis Expert System can help a great deal in identifying those diseases and describing methods of treatment to be carried out.

Design a knowledge-base expert system that aims to provide the patients with medical advice and basic knowledge on various diseases. It should consider various symptoms and signs like chest pain, cough, fainting, fatigue, headache, back pain, sunken eyes, low body temperature, restlessness, sore throat, fever etc. along with its severity status and provide the patients with medical advice.
